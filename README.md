# Cookie Stand Admin

Lab 37 (React 1) asks to produce an admin page that matches the provided end goal screenshot. Implementation is in nextjs with tailwind for styling. The form and data presented on the page is not yet dynamic; will be added in a later lab.

Lab 38 (React 2) adds to lab 37 features:
    - A reports table showing sales for each cookie stand location now displays if there is sales data to display.
    - The form allows new locations to be added to the reports table.
    - Small miscellaneous refinements!
