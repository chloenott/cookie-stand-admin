# Cookie Stand Admin

Lab 37 (React 1):
* Produce an admin page that matches the provided end goal screenshot.
* Implementation is in nextjs with tailwind for styling.
* The form and data presented on the page is not yet dynamic; will be added in a later lab.

Lab 38 (React 2) adds to lab 37 features:
* A reports table showing sales for each cookie stand location now displays if there is sales data to display.
* The form allows new locations to be added to the reports table.
* Small miscellaneous refinements!

Lab 39 (React 3) adds even more features!:
* Connects with cookie-stand-api backend for authentication/authorization.
* For testing use the following username/password: chloe/asdf
* Cookie stand locations can be added using the form, which the backend stores.
* The cookie stand table retrieves data from the backend.
* A user must log in before access to cookie stand admin is allowed.
* Some styling adjustments to a new spec.
